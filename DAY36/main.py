# API Endpoints

# STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g.
#  [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
# replace the "demo" apikey below with your own key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

# Import data
stock_url = f'{STOCK_ENDPOINT}?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={STOCK_NAME}&apikey={STOCK_API_KEY}'
r = requests.get(stock_url)
data = r.json()
# HELPER - print out data
print(data)

# Get the current date and time
current_date_time = datetime.now()

# Calculate the difference
# Format the date as a string
yesterday = (current_date_time - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
day_before_yesterday = (current_date_time - timedelta(days=2)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Extract yesterdays closing stock price
yesterday_closing = [value['4. close'] for date, value in data['Time Series (Daily)'].items() if date ==
                     yesterday][0]

# TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

# Extract day before yesterday closing stock price
day_before_yesterday_closing = [value['4. close'] for date, value in data['Time Series (Daily)'].items() if date ==
                     day_before_yesterday][0]

print("Today's date is:", day_before_yesterday)
print("Stock Closing Price:", float(day_before_yesterday_closing))
print("Today's date is:", yesterday)
print("Stock Closing Price:", float(yesterday_closing))

# TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#  Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
price_difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing))

# TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before
#  yesterday.
percent_change = (price_difference / float(day_before_yesterday_closing)) * 100
print(f'{percent_change:.2f}%')


# TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
trigger = 5
if percent_change > 5:
    print('Get News')
else:
    print('Dont get news')
## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
# Import data
news_url = f'{NEWS_ENDPOINT}?q={STOCK_NAME}&from={day_before_yesterday}&to={day_before_yesterday}&sortBy=popularity&apikey={NEWS_API_KEY}'
r = requests.get(news_url)
news_data = r.json()

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation
number_of_articles = 3

sliced_news_data = news_data['articles'][0:number_of_articles]
print(len(sliced_news_data))

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

for article in sliced_news_data:
    print(article['title'])
    print(article['description'])

    for _ in article:
        print(_)

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
